My first attempt at designing a custom keyboard, started as a challenge and as a potential new hobby.

Once I'm sure-ish this will actually work, I'm planning to build it as full wireless keyboard (thanks to [nice!nano](https://docs.nicekeyboards.com/#/nice!nano/))

Although it was supposed to be a simple ergo-split, it acquired a couple more functionalities along the way:
- wireless
- optional trrs
- hotswap MX switches
- RGB underglow
- RGB backlights
- rotary encoder
- reversible PCB

I lost count of how many times I've re-done the wiring in pcbnew, tried to keep it as tidy as possible!
